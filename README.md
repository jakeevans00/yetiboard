My first truly custom keyboard. 

## Overview
In this README, I'll walk through my experience on the ergo-keyboard journey. 

First, a little about me though! I'm new to the custom keyboard scene and I don't know how deep I'll eventually go. My aspirations as of now are as follows:
1. Finish one (seriously can't let this be another half-finished project) 

And my specific keyboard goals!
1. 1 key away 
2. Macro-friendly
3. Lok cool

So for now, I've settled on a 38-key design. Taking a lot of ideas from my first ergo keyboard - the Glove80. The only thing I can say for the Glove80 design is that it is excellent. So, for this first stab, I hope to mimic the layout I've been using for the past few months and continue the use of home-row mods, tri-thumb keys, and layers.
